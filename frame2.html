      <p class="info_sec">
        Web development tools (often called devtools or inspect element) allow
        web developers to test and debug their source code. They are different
        from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in
        that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they
        are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web
        application. Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built-in
        features in modern web browsers. Browsers such as Google
        Chrome,Firefox,Internet Explorer,Safari, Microsoft edge and opera have
        built-in tools to help web developers and many additional add-ons can be
        found in their respective plugin download centers. Web development tools
        allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including
        HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by
        the web browser. Due to increasing demand from web browsers to do more,
        popular web browsers have included more features geared for developers.
